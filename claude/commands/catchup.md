description: Read all changed files on the current git branch to catch up on changes
---

Please help me catch up on the changes in this branch:

1. First, run `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` to get the list of all changed files on this branch
2. Then read all of those changed files in parallel using the Read tool
3. After reading all files, provide a concise summary of:
   - What areas of the codebase were modified
   - Key changes and their purpose
   - Any patterns you notice across the changes

Focus on understanding the intent and scope of the changes rather than listing every detail.
